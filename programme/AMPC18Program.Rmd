# Welcome
The University of Western Australia is delighted to host the 2018 Australian Mathematical Psychology Conference in Perth, Western Australia. On Tuesday 13th February there will be a day of workshops on current topics and methods in mathematical psychology and a public lecture by Professor Amy Criss on her work. The conference runs from the 14th-15th Feb with two full days of talks. 

We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Office of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) at UWA, the Institute of Advanced Studies (UWA), the UWA School of Psychological Science, and the Perth Convention Bureau. We would also like to thank those contributing to workshops, especially Prof Amy Criss, who will be leading one of the workshops as well as giving a public lecture on her work.

# Conference Dinner

The conference dinner is after the last day of talks (Thursday, 15th February) at Jojo's Cafe on the Swan River. Dinners are usually held during the conference, but the flight schedules mean that most people will be flying out on 16th anyway, and this means no-one needs to worry about a 9am talk the next day.
The venue is approximately a 25 minute walk from the conference. You could also catch the number 24 bus near the venue. Drinks and canapés will be available from 6pm and we'll be seated for dinner around 7pm.

# Soccer 

We will have the what was the traditional cricket game (now soccer) at the end of the first day of the conference (Wednesday, February
14th). At the end of the schedule (~ 5.30 pm) we will walk to Riley Oval, which is approximately 10 minutes walk from the conference venue. For anyone who would prefer not to play, there lots of places nearby to sit and talk.

# Workshops

There will be two free workshops held on the 13th February at the conference venue.  

## Morning: Workshop A: Professional Development Symposium
*10am -12 noon, St Catherine's College, UWA*

In this masterclass, we will hear from three senior scientists in the field of Mathematical Psychology about the opportunities for professional development that have been available to them throughout their careers and how they reached their current positions. In particular, we will focus on how they developed their skills in computational modelling and advanced statistical methods. Furthermore, we will discuss the steps that senior scientists can take to support the Early Career Researchers they work with and ensure that we promote gender diversity in STEM. 

This masterclass is supported by the Institute of Advanced Studies at UWA. Professor Amy Criss, Head of Discipline, Psychology, Syracuse University and 2018 Institute of Advanced Studies Visiting Fellow, will be joined in a panel discussion by Associate Professor Amy Perfors (University of Melbourne) and Associate Professor Chris Donkin (UNSW). Discussion will be facilitated by Dr Alice Mason (UWA) who is chair of the Gender Diversity Committee in the School of Psychological Science.  

The masterclass is open to attendees of any gender.  

You can register for the workshop here: http://www.ias.uwa.edu.au/masterclass/STEMresearch  

If you have any questions please contact Alice Mason (alice.mason@uwa.edu.au).


## Afternoon Workshop - Workshop on State-trace Analysis
*2-5pm, St Catherine's College, UWA *

Presenters: John Dunn, Mike Kalish, Rachel Stephens

The aim of this workshop is to provide a brief introduction to the application of state-trace analysis (STA) to psychological data based on the book:
Dunn, J.C. & Kalish, M. L. (in press). *State-trace analysis*. Springer.

The following aspects will be covered (time permitting):

1.       Brief introduction to the logic of STA
2.       Fitting the monotonic model
3.       Analysis of continuous data
4.       Analysis of discrete data

Those attending will need to bring their own laptop to take part in the activities. Some software will need to be installed prior to the workshop; details can be found at [https://alicemason.github.io/AMPC18/_pages/Workshops/](https://alicemason.github.io/AMPC18/_pages/Workshops/) or by clicking on the links below.

* Participants will use the custom STACMR software package developed by the authors. This will require that either Matlab or R be installed (both are supported), as well as java. Any version of java on or after version 1.7 is good. If java is not installed, it can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html.
* [State-trace analysis.pdf (a copy of the book)](https://alicemason.github.io/AMPC18/assets/statetrace/sta.pdf)
* [STACMR-matlab.zip (if using Matlab)](https://alicemason.github.io/AMPC18/assets/statetrace/STACMR-matlab.zip)
* [STACMR-R.zip (if using R)](https://alicemason.github.io/AMPC18/assets/statetrace/STACMR-R.zip)

## Evening: Public lecture by Prof Amy Criss

Prof. Amy Criss will be giving an Institute of Advanced Studies public lecture 6pm--7pm on the 13th in Woolnough Lecture Theatre, Geology Building, UWA (a 5--10 min walk from St Catherine's). The talk is titled "How remembering causes forgetting".
You can find out more details and book a seat [http://www.ias.uwa.edu.au/lectures/criss](http://www.ias.uwa.edu.au/lectures/criss)

"Humans rely on memory at nearly every moment: we use our memories of the past to predict the future, and memory is essential to our concept of self. Nevertheless, our memory for the details of events is imperfect. Some details of an event are forgotten and other details can be falsely remembered. One other striking characteristic of memory is that that act of remembering can change what is being remembered: retrieving events from memory changes our memory of those individual events.

"In this talk Professor Amy Criss will explain how the effects of retrieval on memory can be understood using carefully designed experiments, and show that the accuracy of memory for an event declines as we repeatedly recall that event. She will also discuss how theories of memory can be expressed as computational models, and how we can use computational models to understand how forgetting is caused by remembering."

There are a large number of different models of risky choice that fall into two broad classes; fixed utility models that satisfy the condition of *simple scalability* and everything else. A prominent example of the former is Cumulative Prospect Theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992); a prominent example of the latter is Decision Field Theory (Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993). While it is known that behaviour can be observed that inconsistent with all models, this has largely been based on the construction of special cases. We decided to test the class of fixed utility models against a set of relatively unselected risky choices using signed difference analysis (SDA). The advantage of this approach is that there is no requirement to posit a particular form for the error function that links the difference in the utility of two gambles, *A* and *B*, with the probability of choosing *A* over *B*, $P(A \\succ B)$ . We presented groups of participants with 30 *variable* gambles (*A*) each paired with one of four *fixed* gambles (*B*) and tested the prediction of fixed utility models that $P(A \\succ B)$ has the same order over *A* for all *B* using the statistical test developed by Kalish, Dunn, Burdakov and Sysoev (2016). We discuss the implications of the results and explore a relatively simple extension to a (minimally) more complex model.\\ \\*References* \\Busemeyer, J. R., & Townsend, J. T.
