# Abstract submissions are now open.

Following the format of last year's conference we will have both Full Talks and Brief Talks. 

<b> Full Talks </b> – will be 15 minutes, plus 5 minutes for questions.<br /> 
<b> Brief Talks </b> – will be 8 minutes, plus 2 minutes for questions. <br /> 

As per last year, the goal of including the Brief Talk format is to encouraging participation from graduate students, early career researchers, and people interested in presenting more preliminary findings. Graduate students are especially encouraged to apply for a Brief Talk, and will be given priority for them.
