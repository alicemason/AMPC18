# UWA colleges

Several colleges in close proximity to UWA and the conference venue provide accommodation:

## St Catherine's on Park

<http://www.stcatherinesonpark.com.au>

St Catherine's is also the venue for the conference, and so provides a very short walk to the talks! A variety of studio and bedroom apartments are available, starting from $190.

## Trinity on Hampden

<http://www.trinityonhampden.com.au/guest-accommodation/>

Trinity provides 30 "premium" (3.5 star) guest rooms starting from $130.
Trinity is only a short (5 minute) walk from venue.

# Perth City CBD

There are lots of hotels in the CBD, which is a 15 minute bus ride away from the conference venue. The 950 bus regularly travels between UWA and the Perth CBD.

You can book rooms at the Hilton hotel at a discounted rate of $235 per night.  We will post a link for you to book directly with the hotel soon.
