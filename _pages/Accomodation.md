## University Hall

Uni Hall has a small number of single rooms for approximately $50 with shared bathrooms on each floor and guests have access to a kitchenette area. Contact bookings@unihall.uwa.edu.au for more information. 

# Perth City CBD

There are lots of hotels in the CBD, which is a 15 minute bus ride away from the conference venue. The 950 bus regularly travels between UWA and the Perth CBD.

You can book rooms at the Hilton hotel at a discounted rate of $235 per night.

The following link will allow you to book rooms until the 15th Jan. You'll need to quote the group code 'GUWAN' to access the special rate.
